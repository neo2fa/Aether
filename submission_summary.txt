Project Name: Aether
Track: AI Agents / Open Society
NEAR Leverage: Chain Signatures, MPC, Account Model

Description:
Aether is an AI-powered Omni-chain Treasurer. It solves the complexity of 
multi-chain DeFi by using NEAR as a master controller. Users interact 
with an AI agent that monitors yields and uses NEAR Chain Signatures to 
execute transactions on Ethereum and other chains seamlessly. 

Our project focuses on "One Job": Autonomous Yield Optimization with 
verifiable on-chain execution.
