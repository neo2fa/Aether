# 🌌 Aether: Omni-Chain AI Treasurer

Aether is an autonomous AI agent built on **NEAR Protocol** that manages assets across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana) from a single NEAR account using **Chain Signatures**.

## 🚀 The Problem
Multi-chain asset management is fragmented. Users struggle with multiple wallets, bridge risks, and managing gas tokens (ETH, SOL, etc.) on different networks.

## 💡 The Solution: Aether
Aether acts as a "Universal Control Plane." 
- **AI Brain:** Analyzes the best yields across DeFi (Aave, Uniswap, Burrow).
- **NEAR Chain Signatures:** Executes transactions on any chain without the user needing the native gas token of that chain.
- **One Wallet:** Your `.near` account is the master key for everything.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Smart Contract:** Rust (NEAR SDK)
- **AI Engine:** Python (Logic & Strategy)
- **Interoperability:** NEAR Chain Signatures (MPC)

## 🏗 Key Features
1. **Autonomous Yield Farming:** Agent continues working after you close the tab.
2. **Intent-Based Execution:** Just say "Optimize my portfolio," and Aether does the rest.
3. **Audit Trail:** Every action is recorded on the NEAR blockchain for transparency.
